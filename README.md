# balancr

A Flask app that computes topics from news articles. It uses [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html).

You can select a time frame and choose whether to include headlines, teaser, body or a combination into the analysis.

The result page shows the top ten topics for the given time span as well as the top three topics and their number of articles by medium. Topic labels and summaries are generated by Google's text-bison LLM.

I haven't built a proper frontend yet. This is just for demonstration. Video is sped up. Depending on the number of documents (and your machine) this might take a while:
